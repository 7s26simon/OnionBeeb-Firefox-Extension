3. Perform a search that includes a BBC News article e.g iphone sim BBC News, right-click the link in the results and select from the context menu options

## Private Browsing / Incognito Mode

This addon **requires explicit permission** to run in private windows (as TOR uses private windows as default).  

To allow OnionBeeb in private windows:

1. Open `about:addons` in Firefox.  
2. Find **OnionBeeb** in your list of installed extensions.  
3. Click **Preferences / Options** (gear icon) → **Run in Private Windows** → **Allow**.  

This ensures context menus work browsing privately as TOR does by default.

## Usage

- **Right-click on a BBC News link** to open it in TOR or copy the onion URL via the right-click context menu.  
- **Right-click anywhere** to open the BBC Onion homepage via the right-click context menu.
